# Asher - SaaS Website

Asher is a cutting-edge platform designed for seamless collaboration and communication around PDF documents. Our SaaS website is meticulously crafted from scratch, ensuring robust performance, security, and user experience.



- **Architecture Overview:**
  
  - **Frontend:**
    - PDF Chat's frontend is developed using Next.js, a React framework known for its server-side rendering capabilities and performance optimizations. Next.js enables efficient rendering of dynamic content, making PDF Chat responsive and fast.
    - Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is employed for styling. It offers a wide range of pre-designed components and utilities, allowing for rapid UI development without sacrificing customization.
    - Key features such as infinite message loading and optimistic UI updates are implemented to enhance user experience. These features are seamlessly integrated into the frontend architecture to provide a smooth and engaging interface.
      
  - **Backend:**
    - TypeScript is utilized for the backend, ensuring type safety and improved developer productivity. TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors during development, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
    - tRPC and Zod play crucial roles in handling data fetching and validation, respectively. tRPC simplifies API development by providing type-safe endpoints, while Zod ensures that incoming data is validated according to specified schemas, enhancing the security and reliability of the application.
    - Prisma serves as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, simplifying database operations. Prisma's intuitive API allows for seamless interaction with the database, facilitating efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
    - Pinecone is utilized as the vector storage solution, enabling fast and efficient manipulation of document data. Pinecone's vector-based approach enhances the performance of PDF Chat, ensuring smooth and responsive document rendering.
  - **Authentication and Payment Integration:**
    
    - Kinde is employed for secure authentication, safeguarding user accounts and sensitive information. Kinde provides robust authentication mechanisms, including password hashing and session management, to protect user data from unauthorized access.
    - Payment processing is seamlessly integrated using Stripe, offering users the flexibility to upgrade to premium plans hassle-free. Stripe's powerful API and extensive documentation make it easy to implement secure and reliable payment processing, providing a seamless user experience.
  - **Real-time Communication:**
    
    - Real-time communication is a core feature of PDF Chat, allowing users to collaborate and communicate instantly while viewing PDF documents. Socket.IO is used to establish real-time communication channels between users, enabling instant messaging and document updates.
    - This functionality is achieved through streaming API responses, ensuring timely updates and fostering dynamic collaboration. By delivering updates in real-time, PDF Chat enhances collaboration and productivity, enabling users to work together seamlessly.
